This is the bastardization of the HTML5 Blank for the theme of my blog.

# What change?

* Remove JSHint (Cause I couldn't care less how my JS looks like)
* Show admin bar (Cause I love that shit)
* Scripts on footer (Cause perf...)
* ...More to love

Work in progress! Feel free to fork and make it your own but make your own style and design your own blog, mmkay? ‚ù§
